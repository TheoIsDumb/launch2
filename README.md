A (very barebones) theme for [Bridge Launcher](https://github.com/bridgelauncher).

Made with HTML, TailwindCSS & JS.

## how to use

1. clone/download the repo.
2. install bridge launcher.
3. choose repo as project directory in bridge launcher settings.

## notes

1. i didn't use bridgemock, i just rsync'd the whole dir to my phone, everytime i made a change. (really bad way, do not recommend)

2. and i used tailwind's standalone "binary" and not the npm package. (you could install tailwind as a global npm package and use it.)

3. live wallpaper is inside `Assets/` directory.
